# Creative Writing Probing Questions

Before I begin writing, I'd like to understand your vision better. Please answer these probing questions:

## Purpose & Audience
1. **What is the purpose of this piece?** To inform, persuade, entertain, inspire, or something else?
2. **Who is the intended audience?** Age group, expertise level, cultural background?
3. **Where will this be published/shared?** Blog, social media, print, presentation, personal?

## Tone & Style
4. **What tone are you aiming for?** Formal, casual, humorous, serious, poetic, conversational?
5. **Any writing styles or authors you'd like to emulate?** Reference points for voice?
6. **What emotions should the reader feel?** Inspired, curious, motivated, comforted, challenged?

## Content & Structure
7. **What's the core message or thesis?** The one thing readers should take away?
8. **Are there specific points that must be included?** Key facts, arguments, or themes?
9. **What's the desired length?** Word count, paragraphs, or time to read?

## Context & Constraints
10. **Is there existing content to build upon or reference?** Brand voice, previous work, guidelines?
11. **Are there topics or angles to avoid?** Sensitive subjects, competitor mentions, taboos?
12. **What's the call-to-action (if any)?** What should the reader do after reading?
