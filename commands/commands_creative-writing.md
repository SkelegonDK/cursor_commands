# Creative Writing Probing Questions

## Purpose
Before I begin writing, I need to gather information to craft content that matches your vision perfectly.

## Target Context
- **Domain:** Creative writing, copywriting, content creation
- **Outcome:** Content tailored to your audience, tone, and objectives

## Question Categories

### Purpose & Audience
1. **What is the purpose of this piece?** To inform, persuade, entertain, inspire, or something else?
2. **Who is the intended audience?** Age group, expertise level, cultural background?
3. **Where will this be published/shared?** Blog, social media, print, presentation, personal?

### Tone & Style
4. **What tone are you aiming for?** Formal, casual, humorous, serious, poetic, conversational?
5. **Any writing styles or authors you'd like to emulate?** Reference points for voice?
6. **What emotions should the reader feel?** Inspired, curious, motivated, comforted, challenged?

### Content & Structure
7. **What's the core message or thesis?** The one thing readers should take away?
8. **Are there specific points that must be included?** Key facts, arguments, or themes?
9. **What's the desired length?** Word count, paragraphs, or time to read?

### Context & Constraints
10. **Is there existing content to build upon or reference?** Brand voice, previous work, guidelines?
11. **Are there topics or angles to avoid?** Sensitive subjects, competitor mentions, taboos?
12. **What's the call-to-action (if any)?** What should the reader do after reading?

## Synthesis Instructions
After gathering responses:
1. Identify the primary purpose and audience to set the foundation
2. Prioritize tone and emotional impact to guide word choice
3. Structure content around the core message and required points
4. Apply constraints and avoid prohibited topics throughout

## Constraints
- Reasoning: Ask only relevant questions based on the writing context.
- Scope: Skip categories that don't apply to the specific piece.
- Self-check: Confirm understanding of vision before proceeding to write.
