# New Features Probing Questions

Before I start implementing this feature, I need to understand it better. Please answer these probing questions:

## Core Understanding
1. **What problem does this feature solve?** What pain point or need are we addressing?
2. **Who is the primary user?** Who will use this feature most frequently?
3. **What does success look like?** How will we know this feature is working well?

## Scope & Boundaries
4. **What should this feature definitely do?** (Must-haves)
5. **What should this feature NOT do?** (Out of scope)
6. **Are there existing features this interacts with?** What dependencies or integrations exist?

## Technical Considerations
7. **Are there performance requirements?** Speed, scale, or resource constraints?
8. **What data does this feature need?** Input sources, storage, output formats?
9. **Are there security or privacy concerns?** Authentication, authorization, sensitive data?

## Edge Cases & Validation
10. **What happens when things go wrong?** Error states, fallbacks, edge cases?
11. **How should this behave on different devices/environments?** Responsiveness, compatibility?
12. **Are there any constraints I should know about?** Timeline, tech stack, existing patterns?
