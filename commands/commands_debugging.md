# Debugging Probing Questions

Before I dive into debugging, I need to gather some diagnostic information. Please answer these probing questions:

## Symptom Description
1. **What is the exact error or unexpected behavior?** Error messages, visual glitches, wrong output?
2. **What did you expect to happen instead?** The correct/desired behavior?
3. **When did this start happening?** After a specific change, deployment, or randomly?

## Reproduction
4. **Can you reproduce the issue consistently?** Steps to reproduce?
5. **Does it happen in all environments?** Local, staging, production? Which browsers/devices?
6. **How often does it occur?** Every time, intermittently, under specific conditions?

## Context & Changes
7. **What changed recently?** New code, dependencies, configurations, data?
8. **Are other parts of the system affected?** Isolated or widespread impact?
9. **Have you seen this issue before?** Similar bugs in the past?

## Investigation So Far
10. **What have you already tried?** Debugging steps, fixes attempted?
11. **Are there relevant logs or stack traces?** Console errors, server logs, monitoring data?
12. **Have you narrowed down where the issue might be?** Specific file, function, or component?

## Environment Details
13. **What's the tech stack?** Languages, frameworks, versions?
14. **What's the deployment setup?** Cloud provider, containers, serverless?
15. **Are there external dependencies involved?** APIs, databases, third-party services?

## Impact & Priority
16. **How critical is this bug?** Blocking, degraded experience, minor annoyance?
17. **Who/what is affected?** All users, specific users, specific features?
18. **Is there a workaround available?** Temporary fix while investigating?
