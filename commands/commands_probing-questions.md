# General Probing Questions

## Purpose
Before I proceed, I need to gather information to reduce ambiguity and ensure the project plan is thorough and precise.

## Target Context
- **Domain:** Any task requiring clarification before action
- **Outcome:** Clear understanding enabling precise, tailored execution

## Question Categories

### Goal Clarification
1. **What is the desired end result?** What does success look like?
2. **Why is this important?** What's the motivation or business value?
3. **What's the scope?** What's included and explicitly excluded?

### Context & Background
4. **What's the current state?** Existing work, systems, or constraints?
5. **Who are the stakeholders?** Who needs to be satisfied or consulted?
6. **What's been tried before?** Previous attempts, lessons learned?

### Requirements & Constraints
7. **What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?** Priority ranking?
8. **What are the hard constraints?** Time, budget, technology, regulations?
9. **What dependencies exist?** External factors, other projects, approvals?

### Execution Preferences
10. **What's the timeline?** Deadlines, milestones, urgency?
11. **What format or deliverable is expected?** Document, code, presentation, plan?
12. **How should progress be communicated?** Updates, check-ins, autonomy level?

## Synthesis Instructions
After gathering responses:
1. Summarize the goal and success criteria in one sentence
2. Identify the top 3 constraints that will shape the approach
3. Clarify any remaining ambiguities before proceeding
4. Propose a plan that addresses all stated requirements

## Constraints
- Reasoning: Ask only questions relevant to the task at hand.
- Scope: Adapt question categories based on task complexity.
- Self-check: Confirm understanding before proposing any action.
