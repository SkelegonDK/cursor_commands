# Idea Generation Probing Questions

Before I start brainstorming, I'd like to understand the context better. Please answer these probing questions:

## Problem Space
1. **What challenge or opportunity are we exploring?** What's the core problem to solve?
2. **Why does this matter now?** What's driving the need for new ideas?
3. **What have you already tried or considered?** Previous approaches, rejected ideas?

## Constraints & Resources
4. **What are the hard constraints?** Budget, time, technology, regulations, team size?
5. **What resources are available?** Skills, tools, partnerships, existing assets?
6. **What would make an idea "feasible" vs "stretch goal"?** Risk tolerance?

## Success Criteria
7. **What does a great idea look like?** How will you evaluate ideas?
8. **Who needs to approve or buy into the idea?** Stakeholders, decision-makers?
9. **What's the timeline for implementation?** Quick win vs long-term investment?

## Inspiration & Direction
10. **Are there industries or examples to draw inspiration from?** Adjacent spaces, competitors, innovators?
11. **What would be too obvious or too radical?** Spectrum of acceptable innovation?
12. **If there were no constraints, what would you dream of?** Blue-sky thinking anchor?

## Scope
13. **How many ideas are you looking for?** Quantity vs depth?
14. **Should ideas be similar (variations) or diverse (different directions)?**
15. **What format works best?** List, descriptions, visual concepts, prototypes?
