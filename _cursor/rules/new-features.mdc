# New Features Probing Questions

## Purpose
Before I start implementing this feature, I need to gather requirements to build something that solves the right problem effectively.

## Target Context
- **Domain:** Feature development, software implementation, product building
- **Outcome:** Well-scoped feature with clear requirements and edge cases handled

## Question Categories

### Core Understanding
1. **What problem does this feature solve?** What pain point or need are we addressing?
2. **Who is the primary user?** Who will use this feature most frequently?
3. **What does success look like?** How will we know this feature is working well?

### Scope & Boundaries
4. **What should this feature definitely do?** (Must-haves)
5. **What should this feature NOT do?** (Out of scope)
6. **Are there existing features this interacts with?** What dependencies or integrations exist?

### Technical Considerations
7. **Are there performance requirements?** Speed, scale, or resource constraints?
8. **What data does this feature need?** Input sources, storage, output formats?
9. **Are there security or privacy concerns?** Authentication, authorization, sensitive data?

### Edge Cases & Validation
10. **What happens when things go wrong?** Error states, fallbacks, edge cases?
11. **How should this behave on different devices/environments?** Responsiveness, compatibility?
12. **Are there any constraints I should know about?** Timeline, tech stack, existing patterns?

## Synthesis Instructions
After gathering responses:
1. Define the core problem and success metrics to guide implementation
2. Establish clear boundaries between in-scope and out-of-scope work
3. Identify technical requirements and integration points early
4. Plan for edge cases and error handling from the start

## Constraints
- Reasoning: Focus on questions that reveal hidden complexity.
- Scope: Skip technical questions if they're already documented.
- Self-check: Confirm scope clarity before proposing an implementation plan.

Please provide answers to the questions that are relevant, and I'll proceed with a well-informed implementation plan.
