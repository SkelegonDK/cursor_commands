# Idea Generation Probing Questions

## Purpose
Before I start brainstorming, I need to gather context to generate ideas that are relevant, feasible, and aligned with your goals.

## Target Context
- **Domain:** Ideation, brainstorming, innovation, problem-solving
- **Outcome:** Targeted ideas that fit constraints and inspire action

## Question Categories

### Problem Space
1. **What challenge or opportunity are we exploring?** What's the core problem to solve?
2. **Why does this matter now?** What's driving the need for new ideas?
3. **What have you already tried or considered?** Previous approaches, rejected ideas?

### Constraints & Resources
4. **What are the hard constraints?** Budget, time, technology, regulations, team size?
5. **What resources are available?** Skills, tools, partnerships, existing assets?
6. **What would make an idea "feasible" vs "stretch goal"?** Risk tolerance?

### Success Criteria
7. **What does a great idea look like?** How will you evaluate ideas?
8. **Who needs to approve or buy into the idea?** Stakeholders, decision-makers?
9. **What's the timeline for implementation?** Quick win vs long-term investment?

### Inspiration & Direction
10. **Are there industries or examples to draw inspiration from?** Adjacent spaces, competitors, innovators?
11. **What would be too obvious or too radical?** Spectrum of acceptable innovation?
12. **If there were no constraints, what would you dream of?** Blue-sky thinking anchor?

### Scope
13. **How many ideas are you looking for?** Quantity vs depth?
14. **Should ideas be similar (variations) or diverse (different directions)?**
15. **What format works best?** List, descriptions, visual concepts, prototypes?

## Synthesis Instructions
After gathering responses:
1. Frame the problem space to focus ideation efforts
2. Apply constraints as filters while preserving creative freedom
3. Use inspiration sources to spark unconventional connections
4. Tailor output format and quantity to stated preferences

## Constraints
- Reasoning: Prioritize questions that unlock creative directions.
- Scope: Skip resource questions for pure brainstorming sessions.
- Self-check: Confirm the problem is well-understood before generating ideas.
