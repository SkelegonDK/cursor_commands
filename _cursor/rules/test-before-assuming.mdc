# Test Before Assuming

When working with test failures:

1. **Run the test first** - Execute the failing test(s) before making any assumptions about the cause
2. **Read actual output** - Analyze the real error messages, stack traces, and assertion failures
3. **No speculative fixes** - Do not assume why a test fails based on code inspection alone
4. **Verify after changes** - Always re-run tests after making fixes to confirm the issue is resolved

This applies to unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, and any other test types.
